# OpenCHAMI Quadlet Based Deployment Tool

The OpenCHAMI Quadlet Based Deployment Tool consists of a Python
wrapper and a base configuration designed to deploy OpenCHAMI onto a
host node using the quadlet implementation of OpenCHAMI described in
the [OpenCHAMI Tutorial](https://openchami.org/docs/tutorial/) using a
"`host` mode" configuration that creates and boots a single virtual
managed (compute) node co-resident on the OpenCHAMI headnode host. The
deployment tool can be used either to deploy OpenCHAMI and the virtual
managed node on physical hardware or on a virtual machine, as long as
the virtual machine supports nested virtualization and has sufficient
resources to run both the OpenCHAMI headnode software and the virtual
managed node.

The deployment tool can also run in a "`cluster` mode" in which the
OpenCHAMI head node and all managed nodes are connected to a physical
or virtual network cluster where the managed nodes are not co-resident
on the host node. In this case, the assumption is that the managed
nodes can be powered on, powered off, and reset using RedFish calls to
RedFish instances running on Base Board Management Controllers (BMCs)
accesible across a network from the headnode.

## System Requirements

At present, the deployment tool uses the 'dnf' package manager, which
is an RPM based package manager primarily used on RedHat systems. The
deployment tool expects to run on a Rocky Linux or similar
distribution of Linux.

The deployment tool can currently successfully deploy OpenCHAMI and
bring up virtual compute nodes on x86-64 (amd64) and AMD-64 (aarch64)
hosts. The default configuration assumes x86-64. This README provides
an example configuration overlay to enable AMD-64 operation, as well
as a broader description of configuration overlays.

For `host` mode operation, the deployment tool recommends a minimum of
4GB of memory, 4 CPU cores and 40GB of free disk space on the
headnode. If the headnode is a VM it must support nested
virtualization for the deployment tool to work in `host` mode. On
MacOS, currently, nested virtualization is only supported by VMs
running on an M3 or better system under Apple Virtualization not those
running under KVM.

The deployment tool requires a minimum version 3.9 of Python installed
on the headnode.

The user running the deployment tool must either be `root` or have
`sudo` access on the headnode.

The host system must have `openchami` installed on it either by means
of downloading the release RPM and installing it or by means of
obtaining the source code, building the RPM and installing it. To
install from the release RPM, do the following:

```
# Identify the latest release RPM
RELEASE_VERSION="latest"
API_URL="https://api.github.com/repos/openchami/release/releases/${RELEASE_VERSION}"
release_json=$(curl -s "$API_URL")
rpm_url=$(echo "$release_json" | jq -r '.assets[] | select(.name | endswith(".rpm")) | .browser_download_url' | head -n 1)
rpm_name=$(echo "$release_json" | jq -r '.assets[] | select(.name | endswith(".rpm")) | .name' | head -n 1)

# Download the RPM
curl -L -o "$rpm_name" "$rpm_url"

# Install the RPM
sudo dnf install -y ./"$rpm_name"
```

Installation from source is described in the
[OpenCHAMI Release README](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/release/blob/main/README.md#openchami-releases).


## Installing and Running the Deployment Tool

The deployment tool works best when it is installed in a Python
virtual environment on the host you plan to use as a head node. To
create a virtual environment named `venv` in your home directory, make
sure you have at least Python 3.9 installed and run:

```shell
python3 -m venv ~/venv
```

Once you have created the virtual environment (for example `~/venv`)
activate it as follows:

```
source ~/venv/bin/activate
```

To install the deployment tool use `git` to clone this repository (
[https://github.com/hpe-erl/deploy-openchami-quadlet](https://github.com/hpe-erl/deploy-openchami-quadlet)
) and check out the version of the deployment tool you want. The
version of the deployment tool you need depends on the version of
OpenCHAMI you are deploying. For compatibility information see this
[CompatibilityGuide](COMPATIBILITY.md).

Once you have the correct version checked out, enter the root directory of the cloned repository and use

```shell
pip install .
```

to install it in your virtual environment.

Now you are ready to use the deployment tool. This is done in two
stages. The first needs to be run only when you first start using a
brand-new headnode. The second needs to be run each time you want to
(re-)deploy OpenCHAMI on your headnode.

1. Use the deployment tool to prepare the headnode for OpenCHAMI
deployment:

```shell
sudo deploy_openchami -p
```

2. Use the deployment tool to deploy OpenCHAMI and start a virtual
compute node:

```shell
sudo deploy_openchami
```

__NOTE: If your are running on an arm64 (aarch64) host, you will need
to change the repository URLs in the default image builder
configuration. See the 'Configuration' section below to learn how to
do this using a configuration overlay.__

Assuming this completes successfully, you should be able to become the
deployment user (by default this is `rocky`) and SSH to your virtual
compute node:

```shell
sudo su - rocky
ssh root@compute-001
```

## Configuration

The deployment tool contains a rich configuration that allows for both
future changes to OpenCHAMI and changes to the way OpenCHAMI is
deployed on your headnode. This configuration, in turn drives the
creation of configuration files and scripts used internally to deploy
OpenCHAMI. The base configuration drives a deployment quite similar
to the OpenCHAMI tutorial with virtual managed (compute) nodes. This
base configuration can be modified at run time by providing the paths
to one or more YAML format configuration overlays on the command line.

### Example Configuration Overlay for ARM-64 Hosts

For example, to change the repository URLs in the image builders so you
can deploy this on an `arm64` (`aarch64`) host, all that is required is a
configuration overlay that overrides those URLs. Something like this:

```yaml
images:
  builders:
    rocky-base-9:
      data:
        repos:
        # Note: since 'repos' is a list, all of the elements need to be
        #       specified fully as the new list will completely replace
        #       the list in the default configuration.
        - alias: 'Rocky_9_BaseOS'
          # Change the 'url' field from x86_64 (in the default config) to
          # 'aarch64' in your config to pull packages of the correct
          # machine architecture.
          url: 'https://dl.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/9/BaseOS/aarch64/os/'
          gpg: 'https://dl.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/RPM-GPG-KEY-Rocky-9'
        - alias: 'Rocky_9_AppStream'
          # Change the 'url' field from x86_64 (in the default config) to
          # 'aarch64' in your config to pull packages of the correct
          # machine architecture.
          url: 'https://dl.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/9/AppStream/aarch64/os/'
          gpg: 'https://dl.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/RPM-GPG-KEY-Rocky-9'
    compute-base-rocky9:
      data:
        # Note: since 'repos' is a list, all of the elements need to be
        #       specified fully as the new list will completely replace
        #       the list in the default configuration
        repos:
        - alias: 'Epel9'
          # Change the 'url' field from x86_64 (in the default config) to
          # 'aarch64' in your config to pull packages of the correct
          # machine architecture.

```

### Example Overlay for Cluster Mode OpenCHAMI Deployment

The following is an example configuration overlay for deploying
OpenCHAMI on a cluster with a head node and four compute nodes all
residing on a cluster network 10.2.1.0/24 with an external DNS server
at 10.234.0.1 and a single BMC managing the four nodes and residing on
a hardware management network 10.3.1.0/24 at 10.3.1.1. The MAC
addresses have been collected from the BMCs and compute nodes.

__NOTE: set the RedFish password in here to match the setting on the BMC__

```
# Set the deployment mode to 'cluster' instead of 'host' so that no
# VM will be created on the head node and the cluster will be set up
# to use coresmd-coredns for DNS.

### Working with the Deployment Tool Configuration

When creating a configuration overlay, it helps to know what the
configuration to be overlaid looks like, and what the configuration
looks like after applying the overlay. There are two options to the
deployment tool that allow you to see the contents of the deployment
tool configuration. The first option dumps out the entire contents of
the base configuration file, complete with comments explaining the
pieces. This is a good place to start:

```shell
python3 -m deploy_openchami -b
```

From there you can cut and paste the necessary pieces to create new
configuration overlays.

The second option dumps out the final configuration after applying
your configuration overlay(s):

```shell
python3 -m deploy_openchami -c amd64_config_overlay.yaml
```

This configuration may be in a different order from the base
configuration and is not commented, but it allows you to verify that
your configuration changes were applied the way you want them.

To validate your deployment tool final configuration, use:

```shell
python3 -m deploy_openchami -v amd64_config_overlay.yaml
```

This helps ensure that your configuration is correct and
consistent, and, where possible, required system elements are in place
to support the configuration you have created.

Deploy your newly configured OpenCHAMI system by first preparing the
host node using:

```shell
sudo deploy_openchami -p amd64_config_overlay.yaml
```

then deploying the new configuration using:

```shell
sudo deploy_openchami amd64_config_overlay.yaml
```

If all went well, you should have OpenCHAMI running on a 64 bit AMD host
with a co-located VM serving as compute node.

```shell
sudo su - rocky
ssh root@compute-001
```

The deployment tool has been designed to be able to be run correctly
multiple times on the same host with new configurations, so, if you
tried deploying on an AMD system before reading this part, you should
be able to simply re-run with the new configuration overlay.

This mechanism also allows you to change many other aspects of how your
OpenCHAMI system is deployed. The AMD overlay was simply a convenient
way to demonstrate the mechanism and enable AMD deployments.

## Limitations

The deployment tool currently has the following limitations. Except
where otherwise noted, solutions to these are being investigated and
implemented:

- there is no 'remove' operation in the deployment tool
- while the deployment tool tries to be re-runable, it is not
  perfectly idempotent, so situations may arise where re-running the
  deployment tool fails leaving the host in an inconsitent state. There
  are currently no known instances of this, but with arbitrary
  configuration overlays, not every case can be tested.
- The OpenCHAMI target itself may not be restartable. While the deployment
  tool tries to clear as much residual state as it can, if OpenCHAMI
  won't re-start, then the tool will not re-run. Usually stopping and
  removing OpenCHAMI, then rebooting the headnode and re-deploying
  OpenCHAMI will clear these problems.
- along similar lines, the deployment tool is not protected against
  being interrupted (for example CTRL-C) in the middle of a sensitive
  operation that may leave the system in an inconsistent state -- it is
  safest not to interrupt a running instance.
- the minimum configuration of the headnode can host up to two virtual
  managed nodes. To host more than that, use a host with more CPU,
  Memory and Disk resources.
- issues have been seen with the `openchami-external` podman network
  disappearing after several runs of the deployment tool. This appears to be
  intractable without a reboot, but a reboot of the host node will clear
  it.
- issues have been seen with the digests of boot images not matcing (some
  kind of corruption of the boot image either in or on the way to the
  registry). We are currently stopping the registry, removing both the
  disk resident registry storage and the podman volume and then restarting
  what should be a fresh registry to alleviate this. It does not always
  work. Rebooting the host node seems to clear this problem.
